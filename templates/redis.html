</ul>

<p>Overall, Redis is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of use cases, from caching and session management to real-time analytics and message queuing.</p>

Redis is a key-value store and does not have tables in the traditional relational database sense. Instead, it stores data as key-value pairs. Here's how you can create and delete keys in Redis:

<h1>Creating and Deleting Keys in Redis</h1>

<p>To set a key-value pair in Redis, you can use the `SET` command:</p>

<pre>
SET key value
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
SET mykey "Hello Redis"
</pre>

<p>To retrieve the value of a key, you can use the `GET` command:</p>

<pre>
GET mykey
</pre>

<p>To delete a key, you can use the `DEL` command:</p>

<pre>
DEL mykey
</pre>

<p>Redis does not have a concept of tables like traditional databases, as it stores data as key-value pairs or in other specialized data structures. Keys can be strings, and values can be strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, or other data structures supported by Redis.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Strings:</strong> Used to store text or binary data, with operations for appending, incrementing/decrementing numbers, and more.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Lists:</strong> Ordered collections of strings, with operations to push/pop elements from either end of the list.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Sets:</strong> Unordered collections of unique strings, with operations for adding, removing, and checking for existence of members.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Sorted Sets:</strong> Similar to sets, but each member has an associated score used for ordering the set.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Hashes:</strong> Maps between string fields and string values, with operations for adding, removing, and retrieving fields.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Bitmaps:</strong> Used to store and manipulate bitmaps, with operations for setting, clearing, and counting bits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>HyperLogLogs:</strong> Used to estimate the cardinality of a set, with operations for adding elements and calculating the cardinality.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Redis Query Structure</h1>
<pre>
Redis uses a simple, yet powerful, command-based query structure. 
Each Redis command is a single line of text consisting of the command name,
 followed by arguments. The general structure of a Redis command is:

COMMAND_NAME ARGUMENTS

For example, to set a key to a specific value, the command would be:

SET mykey "Hello Redis"

Here, SET is the command name, mykey is the key, and "Hello Redis" is the value.

Redis commands are case-insensitive, so SET and set are equivalent. Arguments 
are separated by spaces, and if an argument contains spaces, it should be enclosed in quotes.

Redis commands are sent to the Redis server over a TCP connection using a client 
library or a Redis command-line interface (CLI). The server processes the command 
and sends a response back to the client.
</pre>

<h1>Redis Database Configuration</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Binding and Port:</strong> Specify the IP address and port number on which Redis should listen for connections. Example: <code>bind 127.0.0.1</code> and <code>port 6379</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Configure logging settings such as the log file path and verbosity level. Example: <code>logfile /var/log/redis/redis-server.log</code> and <code>loglevel notice</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Choose between RDB (snapshotting) and AOF (append-only file) for persistence. Set the file paths and frequencies. Example: <code>save 900 1</code> (save every 900 seconds if at least 1 key changed) and <code>appendonly yes</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Set a password for server authentication. Example: <code>requirepass your_password</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Configure memory usage settings such as maximum memory limit and eviction policies. Example: <code>maxmemory 1GB</code> and <code>maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Replication:</strong> Configure replication settings for master-slave replication. Example: <code>slaveof master_ip master_port</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cluster:</strong> For Redis Cluster, configure cluster settings such as <code>cluster-enabled yes</code> and <code>cluster-node-timeout</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Other:</strong> Set other configurations like the number of databases, max clients, timeout settings, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>After modifying the <code>redis.conf</code> file, restart the Redis server for the changes to take effect.</p>

<h1>Redis Storage</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In-Memory Data Store:</strong> Redis stores data in memory, allowing for fast read and write operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Redis can be configured to periodically save data to disk (RDB snapshotting) or append changes to a log file (AOF).</li>
  <li><strong>Eviction Policies:</strong> Redis offers eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU) to remove older or less frequently used keys when memory is full.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Redis provides commands to manage memory usage, such as <code>MEMORY USAGE</code> and <code>MEMORY PURGE</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Partitioning:</strong> Redis supports partitioning data across multiple instances to store more data than would fit in a single instance's memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, Redis offers mechanisms to effectively manage and store data, making it suitable for various use cases requiring high performance and low latency.</p>
